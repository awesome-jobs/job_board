### How to review job posts? (for reviewer)

The new [pipeline](https://github.com/awesome-jobs/vietnam/projects/1) allows reviewer to _Add cards_ by dragging new job posts to the _To Review_ column (I will try to automate this step first). Once a review process  commences, the job is to be dragged to the _Review in progress_ column. The result of the review process would be reflected in the moving the card to _Approve_ or _Rejected_ columns.
